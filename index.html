					<p>Warwick was founded in 1983 in Germany. Their first model was the Streamer. It ended getting Warwick into a lawsuit with Spector bass guitars because it's design was so close to one of their models. Warwick won the suit and the Streamer remains one of their most popular models today. What made it unique was the detail of the carves in the top as well as the woods. Cherry wood for the body and Wenge for the neck.</p>

					<p>By 1984 they had already added a second model, the Thumb bass. This bass followed their idea of being unique. It was a very small bodied bass yet had incredible resonance and tone because of the tone woods. The body was made from African Bubinga, which would become a stape wood for the company for years to come. The neck and fingerboard were made from Wenge. They were truley setting themselves apart from other bass guitar manufacturers. The Thumb basses popularity was helped by legendary bass player Jack Bruce. Who owned and loved one of the first Thumb basses ever made.</p>

					<p>In the mid 1990s Warwick had set themselves apart from any other manufacturers. The materials and build techniques were unmatched by anyone. Unique woods, brass hardware and even brass frets put them in a different league from other builders. They had fully streamlined their production with CNC machines. They also milled all of their own lumber and used natural drying processes. Any parts not made in house were made locally in Germany. High quality tuners and bridges made by Schaller, brass nuts by ABM and electronics by MEC.</p>

					<p>The Streamer has had several adeptations since it began in 1983. It now has 4 different base varieties. They are the Stage I, Stage II, CV and LX. They differ in the standard woods used as well as construction style. The variety offeres a bass player to choose this classic body shape in a tone combination that fits his/her needs. The body woods give a tone range anywhere from traditional (Alder and Ash on the CV and LX) to modern (Maple on the Stage I and Afzelia on the Stage II). The necks are Wenge on all except the CV. It has a Maple neck for the most traditional tone combination. The Wenge necks on the rest of the models give a tone called the 'Warwick growl' The electronics are all MEC, though the exact pickups differ from model to model. The Stage II also has a very unique feature in that it comes standard with Nickle frets instead of Bell Brass.</p>

					<p>The Thumb bass has stayed very close to it's roots with only slight changes over the years. It is offered in neck-through (NT), bolt-on(BO) and single-cut (SC) constructions. Those constructions each have their own unique wood combinations though all use similar MEC pickups and electronics. The pickup placement give the Thumb NT and BO a very punchy tone. The pickups are pushed all the way back to the bridge. The NT has a figured Bubinga body, Wenge neck and Ebony fingerboard. This was the first Warwick bass with made with this combination of woods and has become one of the most popular combinations responsible for the unmistakable tone in Warwick basses. The BO uses an Ovangkol body and Wenge neck and fingerboard. Ovankol is less expensive than Bubinga and has very similar tone properties to Wenge. Matching that with the Wenge fingerboard makes this one of gnarliest sounding models. The SC has a much more unique combination of woods. The body is made up of a top wood and back wood. Ash on bottom and Bubinga on the top. This saves money and weight without loosing too much Bubinga tone. The neck is Maple with an Ebony fingerboard. Maple saves weight and adds a some warm depth to the tone.</p>

					<p>The Corvette was introduced in 1987 and immediately made itself a staple in the Warwick lineup. It was the first bass that was entirely bolt-on construction. That kept costs down and made it the most affordable Warwick bass. It has a Bubinga body and Wenge neck and fingerboard. It was the first bass they mass produced on the CNC machines making it the most produced Warwick model. It is now offered in three styles. The standard, $$ (double buck) and NT. The standard and $$ are both offered with the same neck and a choice of Bubinga or Ash for the body. The difference is the pickups. The $$ has two humbucking pickups and that is where it gets it's name. The NT keeps the $$ pickups and Bubinga body, but switches to a Maple neck. Changing the tone, but also saving weight.</p>

					<p>The Dolphin is the most unique body design of all Warwick basses. It's geometry is inspired by the rombus. Making it's debut in 1989 as the most high-end and covetted of all Warwick models. It was entirely hand made by the founder of Warwick until 1994. It was the last instrument to be programmed into the CNC machines. It is unique in many ways. The body was origionally made of Biore wood. A very hard wood yet porus making the tone very unique. Biore is hard to find so they switched to Ovangkol. Ovankol has the closest tone to Biore so it kept it's tonal characteristics. The picks are more unique in that they use a twin jazz pickup in the bridge possition. It is also one of the only Warwick basses to have neck inlays be standard. I personally think the Dolphin is the coolest looking and best sounding Warwick bass.</p>
